# Ethiopian Coffee Analysis

This is my first data analysis project exploring Ethiopia's coffee production, exports, and impact. As an aspiring machine learning engineer, Iâ€™m building hands-on projects using real Ethiopian data.

## About the Project

Coffee is one of Ethiopia's most important exports and deeply connected to our culture. In this project, I use Python (Pandas & Matplotlib) to:

- Explore trends in coffee production
- Visualize export data over time
- Analyze regional differences in yield

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Goal

To understand real-world data, build my skills in data analysis, and create meaningful projects that connect to my roots.
